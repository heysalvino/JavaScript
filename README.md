# JavaScript

## Problems

### Babel
- Research and explain what Babel is and its relevance for modern JavaScript developers.
- Babel is a free, open-source JavaScript compiler and configurable transpiler used in web development.
- It allows developers to compile JavaScript code into versions that are compatible with various browsers.

### Chalk and Rainbows
- Install `chalk` module using `npm`:
  ```
  $ npm install chalk
  ```
- Create a file `chalk.js` and run provided code to understand how `chalk` works.
- Develop a function to print rainbow-colored text, with each letter in a different color.
- Use `chalk.keyword('color')` for color specifications.
- Test your code with strings: "Taste the rainbow" and "Rainbow in the dark".

### The Doomsday Rule
- Implement the Doomsday Rule algorithm in `doomsday.js`.
- The script should identify the day of the week for any given date in 2018.
- Use the `readline` module for console input.
- Provide logic to calculate the day of the week based on the distance from known doomsday dates.
- Note: Avoid using `readline-sync`; focus on asynchronous input methods.

### 10001st Prime
- Solve Project Euler problem 7 in `primes.js`.
- Identify the 10001st prime number.
- Optimize the solution using the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
- Keep a list of identified primes for efficient primality testing.


## Additional Notes
- Focus on writing efficient and clean code.
- Test your programs thoroughly before submission.
- Adhere to best practices in JavaScript programming and Git usage.
